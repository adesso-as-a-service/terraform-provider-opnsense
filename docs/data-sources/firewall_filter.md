# opnsense_firewall_filter (Data Source)

Firewall filter rules can be used to restrict or allow traffic from and/or to specific networks as well as influence how traffic should be forwarded

~> This resource requires the `os-firewall` plugin to be installed. It will *not* behave correctly if it is not installed.

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) UUID of the resource.

### Read-Only

- `action` (String) Choose what to do with packets that match the criteria specified below. Hint: the difference between block and reject is that with reject, a packet (TCP RST or ICMP port unreachable for UDP) is returned to the sender, whereas with block the packet is dropped silently. In either case, the original packet is discarded. Available values: `pass`, `block`, `reject`.
- `description` (String) Optional description here for your reference (not parsed). Must be between 1 and 255 characters. Must be a character in set `[a-zA-Z0-9 .]`.
- `destination` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--destination))
- `direction` (String) Direction of the traffic. The default policy is to filter inbound traffic, which sets the policy to the interface originally receiving the traffic. Available values: `in`, `out`.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable this firewall filter rule.
- `gateway` (String) Leave as `""` to use the system routing table. Or choose a gateway to utilize policy based routing.
- `interface` (Set of String) The interface(s) on which the packets must come in to match this rule.
- `ip_protocol` (String) Select the Internet Protocol version this rule applies to. Available values: `inet`, `inet6`.
- `log` (Boolean) Log packets that are handled by this rule.
- `protocol` (String) Choose which IP protocol this rule should match.
- `quick` (Boolean) If a packet matches a rule specifying quick, then that rule is considered the last matching rule and the specified action is taken. When a rule does not have quick enabled, the last matching rule wins.
- `sequence` (Number) Specify the order of this filter rule.
- `source` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source))

<a id="nestedatt--destination"></a>
### Nested Schema for `destination`

Read-Only:

- `invert` (Boolean) Use this option to invert the sense of the match.
- `net` (String) Specify the IP address, CIDR or alias for the destination of the packet for this mapping.
- `port` (String) Specify the port for the destination of the packet for this mapping.


<a id="nestedatt--source"></a>
### Nested Schema for `source`

Read-Only:

- `invert` (Boolean) Use this option to invert the sense of the match.
- `net` (String) Specify the IP address, CIDR or alias for the source of the packet for this mapping.
- `port` (String) Specify the source port for this rule. This is usually random and almost never equal to the destination port range (and should usually be `""`).
